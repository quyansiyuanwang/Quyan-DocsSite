| Create / edit / delete templates      | `REMOTE_TERMINAL_PRODUCT_WRITE`            |
| View entitlements                     | `REMOTE_TERMINAL_ASSIGNMENT_READ`          |

| Revoke devices                        | `REMOTE_TERMINAL_DEVICE_WRITE`             |

## Common actions

1. Create a template, set billing units and prices, save, then publish.
2. In the entitlements tab, assign the plan to a user with device and terminal limits.
3. Share the registration token with the user — they install the agent on their device to complete binding.
4. To reclaim a device, find it in the devices tab and revoke it.

## Notes

- All write operations (create, edit, publish, delete, assign) require a **step-up 2FA challenge**.
- Once published, a plan is visible to all users and can be self-claimed via `POST /remote-terminal/products/me/entitlements/claim`.
- Entitlements support renewal and upgrade (adjusting device or terminal limits).
